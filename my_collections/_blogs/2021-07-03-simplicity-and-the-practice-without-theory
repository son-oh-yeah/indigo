My two favorite quotes by Leonardo Da Vinci: 
> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. 
and,
> He who loves practice without theory is like the sailor who boards ship without a rudder and compass and never knows where he may cast.

I want to say less and do more, sharing my experiences and exploration with everyone. That's a way to save my time and validate my ideas when design. However, how to make them easy to understand for the ones who do not like theory much ðŸ˜…. Thatâ€™s a big deal and also is my mission in the design challenge.

## **User problems**

- They do not know when their bill will be due, they can miss them through other channels such as email or SMS.
- They were feeling in lost control when their bill was paid without a reminder.

## Ideas

- Users can register reminder for their bill when after payment
- User can change the day to remind monthly
- User can turn-off reminder when they donâ€™t need
- We push notifications  and IAM via app mobile / website

## Prototypes

### Register reminder after payment

- Suggest user register reminder at the success screen after payment
- User can change the day to remind monthly

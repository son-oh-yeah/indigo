### What is the simplicity

My two favorite quotes by Leonardo Da Vinci: 
> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. 
and,
> He who loves practice without theory is like the sailor who boards ship without a rudder and compass and never knows where he may cast.

When I am thinking about simplicity, I always associate it with complication.
A pretty good quote mentioned in [this article](https://spiderum.com/bai-dang/Suy-nghi-don-gian-khong-giup-cuoc-song-cua-ban-don-gian-8w0) that I liked.

> “Whenever we seek to avoid the responsibility for our own behavior, we do so by attempting to give that responsibility to some other individual or organization or entity. But this means we then give away our power to that entity.”
> 
> ― M. Scott Peck, The Road Less Traveled: A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth

When you have experienced and understood, the mastery of understanding the nature of object leads to simplicity. That means, when we explain the nature of objects carefully, we can see that it is simple, instead of simplifying the problem yourself to avoid the difficulty to find a gentle approach to yourself.

### Practice Based Learning

I am not saying learn the theory then go to work, but we should use the knowledge and experience of our predecessors imparted to us.

I want to say less and do more, sharing my experiences and exploration with everyone. That's a way to save my time and validate my ideas when design. However, how to make them easy to understand for the ones who do not like theory much 😅. That’s a big deal and also is my mission in the design challenge.

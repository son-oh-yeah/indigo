description: "This post is part of The Software Architecture Chronicles, a series of posts about Software Architecture. In them, I write about what Iâ€™ve learned on Software Architecture, how I think of it, and how I use that knowledge. The contents of this post might make more sense if you read the previous posts in this series."

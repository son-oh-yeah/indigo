### Building [My Blog]({{ site.url }}/blog)
I'd like to sharing and archive the knowledges of design in life, what things I observed and enlightened. Write more articles on Medium to reflect and improve myself about the experience, perception, and discovered things.

### Study about Design System
Build a methodology in designing system design.
- [Apply OOAD in the building design system](https://medium.com/@sonkd/apply-ooad-in-the-building-design-system-with-figma-part-1-b31e64936083).
- [Design Token](https://sonkd.medium.com/about-design-token-in-design-system-5c2a87c31ae4)
- Build a Figma plugin to help my colleagues link the components and styles in our design system.

### My UX
My career path is being a <a class="evidence">Product designer</a>. Now, I'm doing these bellow:
- Practice more as a Product designer
- Doing UX Research (Usability Testing, IDI, Market research-Conduct the competitive audit)
- Building customer journey of a customer in bill payment experience

### Habits to keep
- Keep reading books and articles.
- Spend as much time as I can with my family (My wife and I have the same hobby of staying at home instead of going outside so far, especially in the second Covid year :D ).

### Aspirations for 2021
- Off Facebook ü•ä
- Run every morning üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

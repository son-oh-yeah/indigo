As an experienced designer with three years of experience in game design and and UX designer from 2016 currently.

### BUILDING [MY BLOG]({{ site.url }}/blog)
I'd like to sharing and archive the knowledges of design in life, what things I observed and enlightened. Write more articles on Medium to reflect and improve myself about the experience, perception, and discovered things.

### STUDYING ABOUT DESIGN SYSTEM
